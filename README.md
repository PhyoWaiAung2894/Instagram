Instagram

This project is an Instagram-like app built programmatically using UIKit with some parts initialized using Storyboard. The purpose of this app is to provide a hands-on experience with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, and demonstrate how to build an app from scratch with mock data, login, and registration functionalities using Firebase.

Features

• Programmatic UI with UIKit: All UI components are created programmatically without using Storyboards or XIB files.
• MVC Architecture: The project follows the MVC design pattern to separate concerns and manage code effectively.
• Mock Data: Includes mock data for posts, comments, and users to simulate a real Instagram feed.
